        <h3>Avatar 2</h3>
        <p>Ratting : 8/10</p>
        <p>Story: A worthy sequel to the 2009 film Avatar, James Cameron takes us back to the stunning world of Pandora, where human turned Na'vi Jake Sully (Sam Worthington) and Na'vi princess Ney'tiri (Zoe Saldaña) must do everything it takes to protect their children from the ‘sky people’ (humans from earth).</p>
        <p>Review: “The way of water connects all things. The sea is our home before our birth and after we die.” Beyond the 3D visual spectacle that Avatar is, something we trust James Cameron to deliver, the franchise’s beauty lies in its underlying spiritual arc and ode to continuity of life. Life finds a way. It evolves no matter the surroundings as love is transformative.</p>

        <h3>Dhamaka</h3>
        <p>Ratting : 8.7/10</p>
        <p>Story: Swamy and Anand (Ravi Teja in a dual role), who look exactly the same, come from different backgrounds and have their own struggles. Under dicey circumstances Pranavi (Sreeleela), a young and pretty girl falls in love with both of them. How did Swamy and Anand solve their problems? Whom did Pranavi finally choose? Or is there a twist in the tale?</p>
        <p>The film has music by Bheems Ceciroleo, story-screenplay-dialogues by Prasanna Kumar Bezawada, cinematography by Karthik Gattamneni, editing by Prawin Pudi, art direction by Sri Nagendra Tangala, writing by Sai Krishna, stunts by Ram Laxman and Venkat, lyrics by Ramajogayya Sastry, Kasarla Shyam and Suddala Ashok Teja and choreographers Sekhar VJ, Jani Master and Yash.
          Overall, Dhamaka is an action-packed comedy that relies heavily on mass entertainment quotient. Ravi Teja’s energy and Sreeleela’s glamour make this routine story an entertaining watch.</p>

        <h3>18 Pages</h3>
        <p>Ratting : 7.8/10</p>
        <p>Story: Siddharth (Nikhil) is a mobile phone addict and an app developer who goes through a heartbreak early on. The hasty and sketchy portrayal of that romance, breakup and his subsequent shedding tears on the Durgam Cheruvu cable bridge and pretty much everywhere in Hyderabad barely moves us. It is by design. It is the writer’s and director’s way of telling us that he hasn’t yet found true love. </p>
        <p>Review: Nikhil Siddhartha's 18 Pages is a different film with convincing performances and new concepts. The movie makes for a good watch if you want to experience a Sukumar trademark film story and narration.</p>

        <h3>Driver Jamuna</h3>
        <p>Ratting : 8.6/10</p>
        <p>Story: Jamuna, a cab driver, finds herself in trouble when three contract killers get in for a ride. Can she save herself from this horrific situation?</p>
        <p>Review:  Aishwarya Rajesh is one of the promising stars in the Tamil film industry. With solid projects in her kitty, she has proved her mettle as an actress with her choice of her films. With a film like Driver Jamuna, which is about a woman cab driver, the anticipation surrounding the film is quite high. Will Driver Jamuna deliver?p>
